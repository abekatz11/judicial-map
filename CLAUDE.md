# US Federal Courts Interactive Map

An Observable Framework project for visualizing US federal judicial districts and circuit courts with D3.js.

## Project Goals

Build an interactive map that allows users to:
- Click on federal judicial districts (94 total) to see detailed information
- View circuit court boundaries (13 circuits)
- Explore judge information (who appointed them, when confirmed, senior status)
- See caseload statistics by district
- Track where SCOTUS cases originate (which circuit/district)
- Browse ongoing federal cases, appeals, and decisions

## Project Directory Notes

### `judicial-boundaries/` (Ignored, Not Part of Project)

This directory may exist if cloned locally for contributing pull requests to the upstream data source repository. It is **NOT** part of this project and should be **disregarded** during development.

**Purpose**: The `cbupp/judicial-boundaries` repository contains the GeoJSON boundary data we use. If a data quality issue is found (e.g., typos in circuit names), we clone that repository here temporarily to fix issues upstream via pull requests.

**Status**:
- Gitignored (not tracked in this project's version control)
- Temporary - can be deleted after PRs are submitted
- Located here for convenience only

**Do not**:
- Include it in project builds
- Reference it in code (use `src/data/*.json` instead)
- Commit it to this repository

## Architecture

### Framework: Observable Framework

Chosen to learn Observable Framework and leverage its strengths:
- Native D3.js integration
- Data loaders that run at build time
- Reactive JavaScript in markdown files
- Static site generation
- Built specifically for data visualization projects

### Data Sources (To Be Implemented)

#### 1. GeoJSON Boundaries ✅ Sources Identified
- **cbupp/judicial-boundaries** (GitHub):
  - `us-district-courts.geojson` (94 districts)
  - `us-court-of-appeals.geojson` (13 circuits)
  - MIT licensed, created 2014
  - Based on fedstats.gov data (now defunct) + Wikipedia map references
- **Alternative**: HIFLD (Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data)
- **Alternative**: US Census TIGER files (requires conversion to GeoJSON)

#### 2. Judge Data
- **Federal Judicial Center (fjc.gov)**: Biographical Directory
- Format: Likely CSV download
- Contains: Judge names, appointing president, confirmation dates, senior status

#### 3. Caseload Statistics
- **FJC Integrated Database (IDB)**: District-level caseload data
- **uscourts.gov**: Statistical tables
- Format: CSV or Excel downloads

#### 4. SCOTUS Case Origins
- **Supreme Court Database (scdb.wustl.edu)**
- Free download, CSV format
- Variables track which circuit/district cases originated from

#### 5. Dynamic Case Data ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **CourtListener API** (Free Law Project) - https://www.courtlistener.com/
- REST API for opinions, dockets, judges, PACER data
- Free tier: 5,000 queries/hour to authenticated users
- **Authentication**: Token-based (stored in `.env` file)
- **Registration**: https://www.courtlistener.com/register/
- **API Docs**: https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/
- **Current Usage**: Fetching 20 most recent cases per circuit (260 total)
- **Data Included**: Case names, docket numbers, filing dates, status, URLs
- **Rate Limiting**: ~1 second between requests to be respectful
- **Alternative**: Caselaw Access Project (Harvard) - not currently used

```

### Data Loaders (Build-Time Processing)

Observable Framework's data loaders run at build time, not in the browser. They:
- Fetch/read source data files
- Transform and clean data
- Aggregate and compute statistics
- Output JSON for the site to consume

Example loader (`src/data/judges.json.js`):
```javascript
import * as d3 from "d3";

const judges = await d3.csv("../../source/fjc-judges.csv");
const activeJudges = judges.filter(d => d.status === "active");

process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(activeJudges));
```

### D3 Map Features

- **TopoJSON** format for compressed GeoJSON (faster loading)
- **Zoom/pan** with `d3.zoom()`
- **Click handlers** on district paths to navigate to detail pages
- **Choropleth coloring** based on metrics (caseload, judge count, etc.)
- **Layer toggle** between district view and circuit view
- **Tooltips** on hover showing basic stats
- **Projection**: `d3.geoAlbersUsa()` for proper US map display

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: `npm install`
2. **Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add API keys
3. **Generate pages**: Run page generation scripts when data changes
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-circuit-pages-simple.js
   node scripts/generate-district-pages-simple.js
   ```
4. **Dev server**: `npm run dev` (auto-reloads on changes)
   - Main map at http://localhost:3000
   - Hot reload for markdown/JS changes
   - Data loaders re-run when referenced files change
5. **Build**: `npm run build` (generates static site in `dist/`)
   - Executes data loaders (fetches fresh case data)
   - Processes all markdown files
   - Bundles dependencies
   - Outputs ~109 static HTML pages
6. **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` (Cloudflare Pages)

### Page Generation Scripts

**Why needed?** Observable Framework doesn't have true dynamic routing like Next.js, so we generate static pages for each circuit and district.

**How they work:**
1. Read GeoJSON data to get list of circuits/districts
2. Generate slug from name (e.g., "First Circuit" → "first-circuit")
3. Create markdown file for each with template
4. Template includes: map visualization, case data, metadata

**When to regenerate:**
- When template changes (update display/styling)
- When adding new data fields
- One-time generation (pages are static once created)

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/generate-circuit-pages-simple.js` - Creates 12 circuit pages
- `scripts/generate-district-pages-simple.js` - Creates 94 district pages

### Deployment Strategy

Static site to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages with automated data updates.

**Deployment Options:**
- **courts.abekatz.com** (subdomain) - Recommended
- **abekatz.com/courts** (subdirectory routing)
- **Separate Cloudflare Pages project**

#### Manual Deploy
```bash
npm run build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist
```

#### Automated Data Updates (PLANNED)

**Challenge**: Case data is fetched at build time, so it becomes stale unless rebuilt.

**Solution**: GitHub Actions scheduled workflow

**Setup Plan:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/update-data.yml`
2. Schedule: Daily or weekly at midnight UTC
3. Actions: Install deps → Fetch fresh data → Build → Deploy
4. Store CourtListener API key in GitHub Secrets
5. Configure Cloudflare Pages GitHub integration
6. Add manual trigger option (workflow_dispatch)

**Sample Workflow:**
```yaml
name: Update Case Data
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:      # Manual trigger
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
        env:
          COURTLISTENER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.COURTLISTENER_API_KEY }}
      - run: npx wrangler pages deploy dist
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic fresh data without manual intervention
- Scheduled updates (set frequency as needed)
- Manual trigger available when needed
- Free on GitHub Actions (2,000 minutes/month)
- Timestamp on pages shows data freshness

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build static site
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npm run deploy

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Session Rules

### Git Workflow (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
**Commit and push work regularly without being prompted:**
1. **After completing a logical unit of work** (feature, fix, refactor), create a commit
2. **After 3-5 commits**, push to GitHub automatically
3. **At the end of each session** or when user says "done" or similar, commit and push any uncommitted work
4. **Use descriptive commit messages** following conventional commit format when appropriate
5. **Include Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>** in all commits

**When to commit:**
- After adding a new feature
- After fixing a bug
- After completing a refactor
- After updating documentation
- Before risky operations (to create a restore point)

**Commit message format:**
```
Brief description in imperative mood

Detailed explanation if needed:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any important notes

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Never commit:**
- `.env` files (should be gitignored)
- Large binary files without discussion
- `node_modules/` or build artifacts
- Personal credentials or secrets

### General Rules
- You are always allowed to run: `git`, `gh`, `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `npm` commands
- **Do NOT attempt to download datasets automatically** - user will handle data retrieval separately
- Focus on framework setup, data loader scaffolding, and D3 visualization code

## Technical Notes & Lessons Learned

### Data Quality
- **Upstream typo fixed**: Found "Eigth Circuit" typo in cbupp/judicial-boundaries
- **Contributed fix**: Submitted PR #1 to fix typo for the community
- **Local fix applied**: Updated our local data files with correct spelling

### Observable Framework Specifics
- **FileAttachment references**: Data loaders (`.json.js`) output `.json` files
  - Reference as: `FileAttachment("data/file.json")` not `file.json.js`
- **HTML rendering**: Use `html` template tag from htl to render HTML
  - Regular template literals are escaped by default for security
- **Build-time data**: Data loaders run during build, not in browser
  - Fresh data requires rebuilding the site
  - Timestamps track data freshness

### API Integration
- **CourtListener authentication**: Token-based, stored in `.env`
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful 1-second delays between requests
- **Search results**: Basic case info, full details require docket API
- **Missing fields**: Judge/panel names often empty in search results
- **Originating district**: Requires additional docket API call per case

### Performance
- **GeoJSON sizes**: Districts (28 MB), Circuits (10 MB)
- **Build time**: ~15 seconds with 260 API calls for case data
- **Page count**: 109 static pages (1 home + 2 indexes + 106 detail pages)
- **Future optimization**: Consider TopoJSON for smaller file sizes

## Research Notes

Two background research agents explored data sources and technical approaches:
- Found cbupp/judicial-boundaries repo with ready-to-use GeoJSON
- Confirmed Observable Framework is well-suited for this project
- Identified all major data sources (FJC, SCDB, CourtListener, etc.)
- Research transcripts saved but too large to parse completely
- Key searches covered: judicial districts GeoJSON, D3 mapping techniques, data APIs, framework comparisons
